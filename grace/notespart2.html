<h3>lost puppy </h3>
<P>The Lost Puppy Once upon a time, in a small village, there was a little puppy named Max. Max was a playful and curious puppy who loved to explore. One day, Max decided to go on an adventure by himself.</P>
<p>He ran through the grass, sniffing flowers, and chasing butterflies. As he ran further from his home, he didn't realize how far he had gone. When he looked around, Max couldn't see his family or the house anymore.</p>
<P>Max began to feel scared. Where am I? he thought. How will I get back home? Just then, a friendly bird flew down and asked, Why do you look sad, little puppy? Max explained that he was lost and didn't know how to get home.</P>
<p>The bird smiled and said, Don't worry, Max. I will help you. The bird flew up into the sky and looked around.</p>
<p>I can see your house from here. Follow me. Max followed the bird, and after a while, they came to a big tree.</p>
<p>The bird landed on the tree and said, Your house is just on the other side. Keep going straight, and you'll be home in no time. Max wagged his tail, happy and excited.</p>
<p>Thank you, bird. He barked. He ran the rest of the way home, and when he arrived, his family was waiting for him, relieved and happy.</p>
<p>Max learned an important lesson that day. Even when you feel lost, there's always someone who can help you find your way.</p>
