    <h2>About me </h2>
    <p>Grace is an 18-year-old recent high school graduate with a curious mind and a creative soul. She’s an avid reader who finds joy and inspiration in novels, often getting lost in the worlds crafted by words. Her hands are rarely idle—whether she’s crocheting intricate patterns or expressing herself through sign language, Grace brings intention and beauty to everything she does. She has a deep appreciation for communication in all its forms, especially the silent, expressive power of sign language. Grace also loves to travel, drawn to new experiences, cultures, and the stories they hold. Thoughtful, imaginative, and open-hearted, she's stepping confidently into her next adventure, eager to learn, grow, and connect with the world around her.</p>
<p>I also enjoy spending time in the kitchen trying out new recipes—especially comfort food—and love being around animals. Whether it's taking care of a pet or just enjoying their company, they bring a lot of joy to my everyday life.</p>
